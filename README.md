The original research: https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/en/FirmwareProtection.html

This repository contains a port of the original firmware extractor code to STM32L152. The project is generated using STM32CubeMX and uses HAL/LL drivers - therefore should be even easier to port to further controllers.

Tested on NUCLEO-L152RE board reading STM32F031 target.
